## ...introduction to flask
### What is Flask?
    Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin
    Ronacher. Flask’s framework is more explicit than Django’s framework and is also easier to learn
    because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application. A Web-Application Framework 
    or Web Framework is the collection of modules and libraries that helps the developer to write
    applications without writing the low-level codes such as protocols, thread management, etc. 
    Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.
